## üìù Abstract

This repository supports the ACM TORS research article titled:

> **"User Accountability in Cloud-Based Recommender Systems: A Secure and Transparent Framework Using Google Cloud Infrastructure"**

The work introduces an auditable, secure recommender architecture built entirely using Google Cloud tools such as IAM, Cloud Audit Logs, DLP, Access Transparency, and BigQuery. It demonstrates real-time traceability, consent enforcement, and regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA) for cloud-deployed recommendation models.
